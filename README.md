# UniversityProjectCompilation
A collection of some of the coding projects I worked on at University

- The SVG Sharing platform is my final year project, written in PHP PDO with the dissertation primarily investigating back-end web technologies, the project allows users to upload SVG files to the website which can be shared and downloaded by other users.
- The Recipe Site is another PHP PDO project in which users can submit food recipes to the site
- The MiniCabApp files are for a web services project written in ASP.net and C#, the project uses technologies such as LINQ in order to pass data from Passenger and Driver clients.
